# Files2JSON

This is a Python program that converts CSV, XML, or HTML files into JSON format. The program can be installed on your local machine and executed to convert your files.

## Getting Started

### Installation

You can clone this repository by running the following command on your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/CyberOneTechnologies/Files2JSON.git`

After you have the repository on your machine, move into the `csv_to_json` directory:

`cd Files2JSON/csv_to_json`

Then run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

`python setup.py`

### Usage

The program can be run by executing the following command:

`python csv_to_json.py`

Once you run the command, the program will prompt you to enter the path and filename of the file you want to convert. After you enter the name of the file, the program will convert it to JSON format and save it in the `output_files` directory located in the `csv_to_json` folder.

### Troubleshooting

If any issues occur while running the program, make sure you have installed the Python dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file. You also need to check if the file you want to convert exists and if the directory structure (`input_files/` and `output_files/`) is in place.

If there are still issues, please feel free to open an issue on the Github page. We are always happy to help troubleshoot.
